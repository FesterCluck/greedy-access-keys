# greedy-access-keys
Kill all browser keyboard shortcuts, let your accesskeys do what they were meant to.

Warning: It's interesting to note that this kills Page Up, Page Down, and all directional keys for scrolling. Its fairly obvious how to fix this. I just found it an interesting (however obvious in hindsight) that scrolling is handled in this fashion. My gut tells me old IE wouldn't have handled it the same.
